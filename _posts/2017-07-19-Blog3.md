This week we learnt to use some boolean operators. These include "and", “or”, “not”. We also learnt control flow, which gives you the ability to choose an outcome depending on what else is happening in the program. Comparators are the simplest aspect of control flow. These are ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=. Comparators check if a value is equal to, more than or less than another value. Though you have to be careful because = is used when assigning a value to a variable, whereas == is used to show that two values are equal. I have found this the hardest part of python so far so I used the glossary, Q & A forum and hint every time I could, to make suse I could do it and understand it every time.
