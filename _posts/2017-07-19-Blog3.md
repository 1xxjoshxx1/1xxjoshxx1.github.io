I finished pyg latin translator. It worked completely and I tested it out a couple times. Once I was done I had finished Conditionals and Control flow, so I began new course, functions. Functions are defined with 3 parts, the header, the comment and the body. A function has to be called before it will work, and you do this by writing what you want the function to work on, e.g if you want the 10 squared and your function was square( ), you would write square(10) for it to work on your number. I need to start remembering the stuff i learnt last lesson so i can make it through exercises faster, because most exercises use the stuff from the last lesson. Next time I can improve by remembering what i have learnt so that i can apply it in later on exercises.
