This week we kept on doing python in code academy. It got harder than before but i managed to push through and get a badge. It covered loads of  topics: variables and string, and we found out how to link them together. If me and the people near me were stuck on one stage we would help each other out, and this was the best way to get through the course and understand it better. The further i got, the less questions had hints so they got also more hard than last week, and i didn't get as much done.
